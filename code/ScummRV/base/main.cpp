/*
 * Version string and build date string. These can be used by anything that
 * wants to display this information to the user (e.g. about dialog).
 *
 * Note: it would be very nice if we could instead of (or in addition to) the
 * build date present a date which corresponds to the date our source files
 * were last changed. To understand the difference, imagine that a user
 * makes a checkout of CVS on January 1, then after a week compiles it
 * (e.g. after doing a 'make clean'). The build date then will say January 8
 * even though the files were last changed on January 1.
 *
 * Another problem is that __DATE__/__TIME__ depend on the local time zone.
 *
 * It's clear that such a "last changed" date would be much more useful to us
 * for feedback purposes. After all, when somebody files a bug report, we
 * don't care about the build date, we want to know which date their checkout
 * was made. This is even more important now since anon CVS lags a few
 * days behind developer CVS.
 *
 * So, how could we implement this? At least on unix systems, a special script
 * could do it. Basically, that script would run over all .cpp/.h files and
 * parse the CVS 'Header' keyword we have in our file headers.
 * That line contains a date/time in GMT. Now, the script just has to collect
 * all these times and find the latest. This time then would be inserted into
 * a header file or so (common/date.h ?) which engine.cpp then could
 * include and put into a global variable analog to gScummVMBuildDate.
 *
 * Drawback: scanning all source/header files will be rather slow. Also, this
 * only works on systems which can run powerful enough scripts (so I guess
 * Visual C++ would be out of the game here? don't know VC enough to be sure).
 *
 * Another approach would be to somehow get CVS to update a global file
 * (e.g. LAST_CHANGED) whenever any checkins are made. That would be
 * faster and work w/o much "logic" on the client side, in particular no
 * scripts have to be run. The problem with this is that I am not even
 * sure it's actually possible! Modifying files during commit time is trivial
 * to setup, but I have no idea if/how one can also change files which are not
 * currently being commit'ed.
